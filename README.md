Project Description:
The project description outlines the development of a database system for a platform similar to Airbnb, called "MyBnB." The purpose of this database is to support various operations, including listing rentals, user management, bookings, reviews, and more. The project's main components and requirements are described in detail in the project description document.

Getting Started:
To get started with this project, you'll need the following prerequisites:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
MySQL Database Server
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) library
Sample data files (for database population)

Database Schema:
The database schema for MyBnB is designed to capture the essential components of the platform. It includes tables for listings, users, availability calendars, reviews, and more. The ER diagram, relation schema, and SQL DDL statements are provided in the project report.

Implementation:
The project is implemented using Java embedded SQL with MySQL as the database management system. The source code for creating and interacting with the database is included in the project files. Please refer to the implementation section in the project report for detailed information.

Usage:
To use this project, follow these steps:
Install the required software and libraries mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
Create the database schema using the provided SQL DDL statements.
Populate the tables with sample data (if available).
Run the Java application to interact with the database. You can implement a text-based interface for user interaction.
Please refer to the project report for specific queries and operations that can be performed using this database.
